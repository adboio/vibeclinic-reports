# Thanks for visiting the VibeClinic!
Here's what we found.

## Doctor's Orders
Before jumping into the fixes, there are a couple **critical security flaws** I want to point out. I highly recommend fixing these before launching your app. Otherwise, anyone will be able to access your Supabase data, modify your backend code, and change images/videos on your backend.

### Add real authentication
On your Admin page, it's just a password input. This is ok for testing, but here are the risks:

1. The current password is stored directly in your frontend code. That means anyone can open your website, right click > inspect, and see the password.
2. Because there is no real authentication, Bolt has created all of your data as **public**. This means anyone who visits your site can find your Supabase credentials and upload their own images/videos, delete your images/videos, delete your contact form submissions, etc.

### Secure your tables
- Once you have authentication set up, you will also be able to secure your tables. You can use Supabase RLS Policies to do this, so that only you (or only "admin users") have certain permissions.

Bolt can probably help you fix these issues, but if you need further help, please let me know. We can get this resolved during a $49 walk-in visit at the VibeClinic. Book here: https://vibeclinic.io/contact

## Quick fixes for your app
The fixes below will get you going right now, but again - it is **highly recommended** that you implement the Doctor's Orders above!

### Contact Us page - email not sending
- There's a function to send you an email when someone submits a new form - this is not working (at least for me). I'm seeing an error that you need to add a **Resend API key**. I'm not exactly sure how Bolt handles this, but if you want this functionality, I would try this:
  - Create an account at [resend.com](https://resend.com/)
  - Connect your domain following [this guide](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/domains/introduction)
  - Create a new API key following [this guide](https://resend.com/docs/dashboard/api-keys/introduction)
  - Ask Bolt: "I am getting the error: 'Resend API key not configured'. How can I add my `RESEND_API_KEY`?"

If you don't actually want this functionality, and just want to check form submissions in the admin panel, you can clean things up by asking Bolt "Please delete the Supabase edge function `send-contact-email`, and remove this function call from my Contact page form submission handler."

### Admin panel issues
- **"Connection issue"** - this error is actually _not real_. The images are uploading just fine, and you can view them in "Manage Images".
  - **Reason:** this error is showing up because your code is calling a Supabase operation called `listBuckets`, but you don't have permissions to do that, so it thinks the bucket does not exist.
  - **How to fix:** ask Bolt to "Please remove the `checkConnection` functionality from my Admin page."
- **Failed video uploads** - this is because your video gallery table and storage bucket are set to only allow access to authenticated users, and when you sign in to your admin page with just the password, _you are technically not authenticated._
  - **Quick fix:** ask Bolt "Please update the RLS policies for my `gallery_videos` table and `gallery-videos` bucket to match the policies for the gallery images setup. The video bucket and table should allow anyone to view, upload, update, and delete -- not just authenticated users."

### Supabase confusion
It looks like, at some point, your project was using two different Supabase accounts. This could be causing some of the issues in your app.

The correct account is used in most places in your app, but the wrong one is referenced in a file called `FIX_STORAGE_BUCKET.md`. Delete that file to prevent Bolt from getting confused in the future.
