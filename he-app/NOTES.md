## Written summary
Your app was built with [React](https://react.dev), a framework for building **web** apps. Unfortunately, React is not fully compatible with native mobile apps. This problem is usually solved by using a similar framework specifically designed for mobile apps, like [React Native](https://reactnative.dev).

You can still get your app published for the App Store, it just won't be quite as streamlined as Bolt's [recommended approach](https://support.bolt.new/integrations/expo).

## Options for the fix
### 1️⃣ Dev shop re-build
There's no easy or straightforward way to convert a React app to a React Native app, so to do this "right", you'd need to get it rebuilt from scratch.

That's why the dev shop you quoted you so much - they aren't going to use an AI building tool, and there's no simple way to do a direct conversion to a mobile framework, so they'd have to rebuild from scratch.

I still think they quoted you high and added some unnecessary fluff, but that's where they were coming from.

### 2️⃣ Bolt re-build
With Bolt, you _can_ build mobile-native applications by using their [React Native / Expo starter kit](https://expo.dev/blog/bolt-expo-integration-announcement), or [including "mobile app" in your very first prompt](https://support.bolt.new/integrations/expo).

This would give you a React Native app from the start, and you'd be able to deploy it to the App Store quickly following [their guide](https://expo.dev/blog/how-to-get-your-ai-app-to-the-app-store).

However - you already spent a ton of time on this, and I'm sure you'd rather get something in front of your users than spend a bunch of time rebuilding, even if it's not gonna cost you $8k. So that takes us to option 3...

### 3️⃣ Deploy in a "shell" [recommended right now]
To avoid paying $8k, and to avoid rebuilding your whole app, you can use a tool like [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) to basically wrap your app up in a shell that can be deployed as a native app on iOS or Android.

The caveat here is your app might not feel truly "native", because it's essentially just an in-app browser running inside an empty shell with your app. However, I think this trade-off is worth it when it means you can get your app in front of real users ASAP.

## Recommendation
I'd recommend you go with Option 3️⃣, and deploy your app with Capacitor.
