## App state
### Media playback
I was able to test the music playing functionality on my actual iPhone device and it works! Just needed some extra configuration added to the code.

I **think** this might actually be the ticket to getting a smooth Apple review, since we're using the native media player.

### "Safe area" setup
The layout quirks we talked about — mainly buttons sitting too high or low — are now fixed. I didn’t have to adjust individual components; instead, I added “safe areas” at the top level of the app, which automatically adds proper padding across devices. Bolt should respect this configuration when we re-import.

## Next steps
### App Store Submission
I'd like to get this submitted to Apple for review ASAP so we can get early feedback. To start, we'll submit as a beta - they're usually pretty quick & lenient with this round, and it'll give you a chance to install the app on your phone to test it out too.

Here's what I need from you before we can do that:

1. **Supabase access** - I need to grab the API keys and double-check that the premium music content is properly secured. Supabase sometimes exposes data publicly unless permissions are explicitly configured.
2. **Apple Developer access** - please add me as a Developer role. My Apple ID is `adamb14113@gmail.com`
3. **App icon** - Send over the final version if you have one, or I can use a placeholder
4. **App details:**
  - Title
  - Description
  - Availability (countries)
  - Support URL
  - Marketing URL
  - Test credentials (username/password) for Apple reviewers
  - Screenshots (I recommend [AppScreens](https://appscreens.com) or [AppLaunchpad](https://theapplaunchpad.com))

### Project payment
I typically collect payment before publishing to the App Store. If that works for you, please send over your email address and I'll issue an invoice for **$199**.

This includes:
- Packaging and configuration of your app for the App Store using Capacitor
- Fixes to ensure the app runs smoothly on a real device
- Initial App Store submission and handling of the first review cycle (up to 1 hour of review-related fixes — e.g. missing icons, metadata, permissions, or build settings)

This does **not** include:
- Ongoing support beyond the initial submission
- Resubmissions for non-technical or policy feedback (e.g "spam" classification, "needs more native features," business model issues, etc.)
- New features, design changes, or unrelated updates

Future updates:
- Additional submissions or updates after the first App Store release are billed separately.
- Minor revisions (new Bolt builds, metadata tweaks, small fixes): **$49 per resubmission**
- Larger updates involving new features, UI changes, or native functionality: billed hourly at **$100/hr**
- If you expect frequent or ongoing updates, I’m happy to discuss a simple monthly plan instead.

### App payment integration
Integrating in-app payments is outside the current project scope, but I’d be happy to help if you’d like to add that next.

My standard development rate is **$100/hr**, and I’d estimate the integration at **8–10 hours**. No pressure at all — if you’re interested, I can provide a detailed estimate and formal quote.
